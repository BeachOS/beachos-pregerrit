Central place to hold documentation about the project

## Changelogs

The [changelogs](https://gitlab.com/beachos/beachos/tree/master/changelogs) directory contains changelogs for the BeachOS builds.

The [current.md](https://gitlab.com/beachos/beachos/blob/master/changelogs/current.md) file will always contain the changelog for the upcoming build, and can be empty sometimes right after a release.

The other files contain the changelog for that particular build.

The [current.md](https://gitlab.com/beachos/beachos/blob/master/changelogs/current.md) file is renamed to the build number after a build is released.

## wiki

The [wiki](https://gitlab.com/beachos/beachos/wikis/home) is a good starting point and contains lots of useful information.
